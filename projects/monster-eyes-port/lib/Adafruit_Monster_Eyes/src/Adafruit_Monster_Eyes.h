 * @brief Animated monster eyes for RP2040/RP2350 and ESP32.
 *
 * Ported from Adafruit's M4_Eyes by Phillip Burgess. MIT licensed.
 *
 * This is the only header a sketch needs to include: it pulls in every display
 * backend available for the chip you are compiling for.
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 *     #include <Adafruit_GC9A01A.h>
 *     #include <Adafruit_Monster_Eyes.h>
 *
 *     Adafruit_GC9A01A panel0(&SPI, TFT_DC, TFT_CS, -1);
 *     Adafruit_Monster_Eyes eyes(&panel0);
 *
 *     void setup() {
 *       SPI.begin();
 *       Adafruit_Monster_Eyes::resetPanels(TFT_RST);
 *       panel0.begin();
 *       eyes.begin();
 *     }
 *
 *     void loop() { eyes.animate(); }
 *
 * WHERE SETTINGS COME FROM
 *
 * Three layers, each beating the one above:
 *   1. built-in defaults, applied by the constructor
 *   2. setters called BEFORE begin()
 *   3. config.eye on the CIRCUITPY drive, read by begin()
 *
 * So drag-and-drop stays authoritative: whatever is on the drive wins over
 * what the sketch compiled in. Setters called AFTER begin() are live and win
 * over everything -- that is where sensor code belongs.
