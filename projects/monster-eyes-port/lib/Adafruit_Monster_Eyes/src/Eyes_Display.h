/**
 * @file Eyes_Display.h
 * @brief The display backend contract, and a base class for panels that take
 *        pixels a stripe at a time.
 *
 * Adding support for a new display means subclassing one of these two. See
 * extras/PORTING.md for a walkthrough.
 *
 * THE COLUMN CONTRACT, once per frame:
 *
 *     frameBegin();
 *     for (e = 0; e < eyeCount(); e++) {
 *       eyeBegin(e);
 *       for (x = 0; x < eyeSize(); x++) {
 *         uint16_t *p = column(e, x);
 *         // write exactly eyeSize() pixels, advancing p by columnStride()
 *         columnDone(e, x);
 *       }
 *       eyeEnd(e);
 *     }
 *     frameEnd();
 *
 * The stride lets each backend choose its own memory layout AND direction.
 * The renderer's +Y is up, so it produces a column bottom-first while a panel
 * wants it top-first. Rather than reverse it in a second pass, column() hands
 * back a pointer near the END of a buffer together with a NEGATIVE stride; the
 * renderer then fills it in exactly the order the panel wants. The framebuffer
 * backend does the same thing with a negative row stride. Both are verified
 * pixel-identical.
